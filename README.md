# Substrate Runtime Fuzzer
_Reviewed in Dec-2023_

`substrate-runtime-fuzzer` is a [substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) runtime fuzzing harness continuously developed at [SRLabs](https://srlabs.de) since 2020. 

It has been used as a part of our continuous audit process for [Parity](https://parity.io) as well as many parachains in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem.

As a part of the [Substrate Builders Program](https://substrate.io/ecosystem/substrate-builders-program/), this fuzzer has been used on over 30 different projects, finding dozens of critical vulnerabilities in the process.

## How do I use it?

Here are the steps to launch `substrate-runtime-fuzzer` against the [node template runtime](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/bin/node-template/runtime):

```
cargo install ziggy cargo-afl honggfuzz grcov
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
git clone https://github.com/srlabs/substrate-runtime-fuzzer
cd substrate-runtime-fuzzer/node-template-fuzzer/
cargo ziggy fuzz -t 20
```

The `-t 20` option defines a 20 seconds timeout before the fuzzer classifies an input as a "hang".

You can also pass ziggy the `-j n` flag to run $n$ jobs in parallel.

### What is "ziggy"?

[`ziggy`](https://github.com/srlabs/ziggy/) is a fuzzer management tool written by the team at SRLabs.

It will spawn multiple different coverage-guided fuzzers with the right configuration and regularly minimize the corpus and share it between instances.

## How do I use this on my substrate-based runtime?

The first step is creating a project and adding the same dependencies as [this project](./node-template-fuzzer/Cargo.toml).
Then, you can modify the `node-template-runtime` dependency to your own runtime (either as a local `path` or as a git URL).

Finally you should add a genesis configuration to make sure the fuzzer can reach as much of the code as possible.
You can take inspiration from the genesis configuration of the [kitchensink fuzzer](./kitchensink-fuzzer/src/main.rs).
